# CO2-Calculator-Streamlit

## Introduction
This is a simple CO2 emission calculator implemented by [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io). It can calculate the CO2 emission based on the given transportation method and the distance of travel. A pre-defined relationship between the transportation method and the unit emission is stored in the `emission-data.tmol` file.
